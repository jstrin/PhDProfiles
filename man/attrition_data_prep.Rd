began in Fall 2002;
\item \code{Cohort.Size} number of students in the entering cohort;
}

\code{dfAttrition_wide} variables:

}


\code{dfAttrition_long} variables:
\itemize{
\item\code{AcadYear} numeric variable indicating the academic year of the entering cohort (e.g., "02-03" would
have a  value of 2003)
\item\code{Pathyear} string/character variable where the first part indicates the path of exit (with MA,
without MA, total) and the second part indicates the year in program
\item\code{Count} numeric varialbe indicating the cumulative number of students who exited the program
in the given path by the year in program
\item\code{Year} string/character variable indicating the year in program
\item\code{Path} string/character variable indicating the path of exit
\item\code{Per.Cohort} string/character indicating the percentage of the cohort that exited the program
in the given path by the year in program

attrition rates
